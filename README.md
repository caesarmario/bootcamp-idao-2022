As a warm-up before IDAO 2022, we decided to organize the Machine Learning Bootcamp, where we will train participants for future ML competitions. The boot camp is a two-day intensive training that will help you increase your ML knowledge, acquire practical skills in ML contests and learn basic deep learning tools. It will be useful for those making the first steps in the world of ML contests.

The event is open to all undergraduate and postgraduate students. Participation is free, you just need to register. There are no strict prerequisites, but potential participants should at least be familiar with classic ML algorithms (like linear models and decision trees); pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and sklearn libraries.

The boot camp is prepared together with [HSE University’s Machine Learning and Data-Intensive Systems master’s programme](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/mlds/). This online master's programme enables students to gain practical experience in solving machine learning problems and enhance their skills in developing data-intensive systems. The programme is aimed at students who want to delve into machine learning, gain a deep understanding of ML algorithm theory, and acquire practical experience solving data analysis problems.
